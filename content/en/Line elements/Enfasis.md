Markdown uses **asterisks** or **underscores** for emphasis.

You will simply have to wrap words or texts in these symbols to get _italics_ or **bold**.

| MARKDOWN | RESULT |
| ------- | -------- |
| ```*italics*``` | cursive |
| ```_italic_``` | cursive |
| ```**bold**``` | bold |
| ```__bold__``` | bold |
  
Of course, if you want to use both types of emphasis, all you have to do is combine the syntax, wrapping the word between three asterisks or three underscores.

| ```***italics and bold***``` | italics and bold |
| ```___italics and bold___``` | italics and bold|
