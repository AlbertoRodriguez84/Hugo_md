```#``` **pads** are one of the methods used in Markdown to create headers. You must use them ** adding one for each level **.

That is to say,
```
#Header 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6
```
It corresponds to

#Header 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6

You can also close headings with the same number of hash marks, for example by typing ```### Heading 3 ###```. But the only purpose of this is an **aesthetic reason**.

There is another way to generate headers, although this method is **limited to two levels**.

It consists of underlining the headings with the symbol ```` =``` (for heading 1), or with hyphens ```` - ```for heading 2.

That is to say,
```
This would be a header 1
===
This would be a header 2
â€”-
```
There is no specific ```=``` or ```-``` number that you need to type for this to work,
