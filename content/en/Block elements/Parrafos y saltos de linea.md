To generate a new paragraph in Markdown simply separate the text with a blank line **(by pressing enter twice)**

As with HTML, **Markdown does not support double blank lines**, so if you try to generate them they will become one when processed.

To make a line break and start **a sentence on a next line within the same paragraph**, you will have to press **the space bar twice before pressing enter** once.

For example, if you wanted to write a Haiku poem it would look like this:

Â«Walking with their wet paws,
the Sparrow
on the wooden terrace

Where each verse has **two blank spaces at the end**.
