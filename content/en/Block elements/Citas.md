If the quote in question is made up of several paragraphs, you must add the same ``` > ``` symbol at the beginning of each of them.

```
> I believe that animals see in man a being equal to them who has lost his healthy animal intellect in an extraordinarily dangerous way.
> That is, they see in him the irrational animal, the animal that laughs, the animal that cries, the unhappy animal. — Friedrich Nietzsche

> I believe that animals see in man a being equal to them who has lost his healthy animal intellect in an extraordinarily dangerous way.

> That is, they see in him the irrational animal, the animal that laughs, the animal that cries, the unhappy animal. — Friedrich Nietzsche

You can even concatenate multiple >> to create nested citations.
```
> This would be a quote like the one you just saw.
>
> > Inside it you can nest another appointment.
>
> The main quote would reach here.
```

Remember to separate line breaks with >, or >> if you are inside the nested quote; to create paragraphs within the same quote block.
